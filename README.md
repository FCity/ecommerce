# React eCommerce App

## What is it?

It's a sample ecommerce app in React with items to choose from and cart functionality, so you can add and delete items from your cart or empty it completely. Also, the cart is a slideable side panel.

## How it works

Look around, choose how many of any item you want, and add to the cart.
Click the cart icon to slide it open and remove any items you want or hit 'Empty Cart' to remove them all.
Pretty self-explanatory. You know how it goes.

## Why I made it

I wanted to make something simple and practical with React. There's nothing much to it, no backend, no checkout. Just a clean design to demonstrate my skills.
